What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An hidden git folder was created. Since I didn't commit any file in the directory,
    If I run 'git status' I only see one commit called 'initial commit' which doesn't
    track any file.
    I need to do 'git init' because the hidden git folder will track the history of
    all the files inside the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

    The working directory contains all the project files. They might be a lot, so you
    don't want to commit all of it.
    The staging area lets you choose only the files that for you, make sense together 
    for the commit you are doing.
