When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  I would use a remote repository when the directory it's a team project and other people 
  need to make changes on the same files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Because if the repository is shared between a lot of people, if every time we use
	Git there is an auto-update and there are confilt to resolve, is very annoying to
	merge so often !

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	
	fork: is used when you want to work on a GitHub repository and you don't have the 
		  permission to change it. You would use this when you want to add custom
		  feature to an already exsisting library without change the original.
    clone: is used when you want to have a local copy of a GitHub repository on your
           computer. You would use it every time you want to create a new copy of 
           a repository, either personal or not, that is hosted on GitHub.
    branch : is used when you want to add a new feature to a repository without 
             having to change the original code that might be the one of a fully
             working app already published.
