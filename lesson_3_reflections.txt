When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when the directory it's a team project and other people 
  need to make changes on the same files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because if the repository is shared between a lot of people, if every time we use
	Git there is an auto-update and there are confilt to resolve, is very annoying to
	merge so often !
