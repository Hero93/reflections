What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An hidden git folder was created. Since I didn't commit any file in the directory,
    If I run 'git status' I only see one commit called 'initial commit' which doesn't
    track any file.
    I need to do 'git init' because the hidden git folder will track the history of
    all the files inside the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

    The working directory contains all the project files. They might be a lot, so you
    don't want to commit all of it.
    The staging area lets you choose only the files that for you, make sense together 
    for the commit you are going to make. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	By adding a file one at a time, you have more control on the things to commit that
	have a logical correlation.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
How would branches help?

    When you want to add a new feature but you need to keep the current version free
    in case you would need to fix something for production.  

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    Draw a diagram helps you visualize the brach structure because it allows you to view the
    commit history as a big picture. With this visualization you can, for example, easily 
    spot commits that aren't accessible within the current branches and fix the problem.
